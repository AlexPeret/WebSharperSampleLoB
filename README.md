# WebSharperSampleLoB
A collection of samples for WebSharper

## About
This is a collection of samples I've put together while learning WebSharper.

Notice it might not be production ready, but hopefully it can help you to solve a few problems I've faced.

A lot of examples in this project were found on [Try WebSharper page](https://try.websharper.com/) and some blogs (I can't remember all of them but [Kimserey's blog](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/) was one of them). Also, thanks to WebSharper team for answering some questions.

## Documentation
Refer to Help page (left menu) for documentation.

## Known Issues
The tab widget is not working properly for non client routing. Work in progress.

The datepicker widget doesn't support internationalization properly (date format input by user).

## Notes
1. I'm using an extension for FileDrop.js in this project, which doesn't have a Nuget Package yet. I'm providing the assembly for it, but you can find the source code at [its repository](https://github.com/AlexPeret/WebSharper.FileDrop.js).
2. LoB stands for Line of Business and the samples are frequent widgets we find on this sort of application.
